Hi FULL_NAME_REPLACE,<br/><br/>
All outgoing emails to FROM_EMAIL_REPLACE have been blocked for SUB_DOMAIN because we sent it 25 emails in 1 minute.<br/>
If you no longer wish this email to be blocked, remove it from outgoing blocked emails under Company Settings > Allowed/Blocked.<br/><br/>
Thanks,<br/>
